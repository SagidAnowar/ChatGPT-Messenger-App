 ## Usage

ChatGPT Messenger is a chatbot that uses natural language processing to generate responses to user input. It is powered by the ChatGPT API, which uses a deep learning model to generate human-like conversations. This allows us to ask AI for help.

The code imports two SVG images for the bot and user avatars, and then sets up an event listener for when the user submits their message. When the message is submitted, it is sent to the ChatGPT API and a response is generated. The response is then displayed in the chat window with an animation that simulates typing out each character of the response.
